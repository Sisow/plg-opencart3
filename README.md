### About

OpenCart is an online store management system. It is PHP-based, using a MySQL database and HTML components.
The Buckaroo Payments Plugin for OpenCart enables a ready-to-sell payment gateway. You can choose from popular online payment methods in The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany and globally. Start accepting payments within a few minutes.

**Please note:** Buckaroo took over Sisow in 2021 and thereby all of their plugins. This OpenCart plugin has been build by Sisow but it contains a ready-to-sell payment gateway for Buckaroo.
